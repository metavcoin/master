Feature: Contract states

  Scenario: A contract records it's state
    Given genesisTx locks 100 metavcoin to genesisKey1
    And genesisTx locks 100 metavcoin to genesisKey2
    And genesis has genesisTx
    
    And activationTx has the input genesisTx index 0
    And activationTx activates c3 for 1000 blocks
    And activationTx locks change metavcoin to activationTxChangeKey
    And activationTx is signed with genesisKey1

    And inputTx has the input genesisTx index 1
    And inputTx locks 100 metavcoin to outputKey
    When executing c3 on inputTx returning outputTx
    And signing outputTx with genesisKey2

    And validating a block containing activationTx,outputTx extending tip
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 10
  
  Scenario: A contract records it's state with multiple executions
    Given genesisTx locks 100 metavcoin to genesisKey1
    And genesisTx locks 100 metavcoin to genesisKey2
    And genesis has genesisTx

    And activationTx has the input genesisTx index 0
    And activationTx activates c3 for 1000 blocks
    And activationTx locks change metavcoin to activationTxChangeKey
    And activationTx is signed with genesisKey1
    
    And tx1 has the input genesisTx index 1
    And tx1 locks 10 metavcoin to key2
    And tx1 locks 90 metavcoin to key3
    
    When executing c3 on tx1 returning tx2
    And signing tx2 with genesisKey2
    And validating a block containing activationTx,tx2 extending tip
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 10
    
    Given tx3 has the input tx2 index 1
    And tx3 locks 90 metavcoin to tx3_key1
    
    When executing c3 on tx3 returning tx4
    And signing tx4 with key3
    And validating a block containing tx4 extending tip
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 11
  
  Scenario: A contract records it's state with multiple executions and a reorg reverts it's state
    Given tx1 locks 100 metavcoin to key1
    And tx1 locks 100 metavcoin to activationKey
    And genesis has tx1

    And activationTx has the input tx1 index 1
    And activationTx activates c3 for 6 blocks
    And activationTx locks change metavcoin to activationTxChangeKey
    And activationTx is signed with activationKey

    And tx2 has the input tx1 index 0
    And tx2 locks 10 metavcoin to key2
    And tx2 locks 90 metavcoin to key3

    When executing c3 on tx2 returning tx3
    And signing tx3 with key1
    And validating block bkMain1 containing activationTx,tx3 extending tip
    Then c3 should be active for 5 blocks
    And state of c3 should be u32 of 10
    
    Given tx4 has the input tx3 index 1
    And tx4 locks 90 metavcoin to key4
    
    When executing c3 on tx4 returning tx5
    And signing tx5 with key3
    And validating block bkMain2 containing tx5 extending tip
    Then c3 should be active for 4 blocks
    And state of c3 should be u32 of 11

    When validating an empty block bkSide1 extending genesis
    When validating an empty block bkSide2 extending bkSide1
    Then c3 should be active for 4 blocks
    And state of c3 should be u32 of 11

    # put a tx that invalidates activation tx - expect tip to commit to c3 being inactive 
    Given activationTxInputSpendingTx has the input tx1 index 1
    And activationTxInputSpendingTx locks change metavcoin to temp
    And activationTxInputSpendingTx is signed with activationKey

    When validating block bkSide3 containing activationTxInputSpendingTx extending bkSide2
    Then tip should be bkSide3
    And c3 should not be active
    And state of c3 should be none

    # reorg to make bkMain1 the tip - expect committed state to be 10
    When validating an empty block bkSide10 extending bkMain1
    When validating an empty block bkSide20 extending bkSide10
    When validating an empty block bkSide30 extending bkSide20
    Then c3 should be active for 2 blocks
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 10

   # reorg to make bkMain2 the tip - expect committed state to be 11
    When validating an empty block bkSide100 extending bkMain2
    When validating an empty block bkSide200 extending bkSide100
    When validating an empty block bkSide300 extending bkSide200
    Then c3 should be active for 1 block
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 11

  Scenario: A state of a contract persists after reactivation
    Given genesisTx locks 100 metavcoin to genesisKey1
    And genesisTx locks 100 metavcoin to genesisKey2
    And genesis has genesisTx

    And activationTx has the input genesisTx index 0
    And activationTx activates c3 for 2 block
    And activationTx locks change metavcoin to activationTxChangeKey
    And activationTx is signed with genesisKey1

    And tx1 has the input genesisTx index 1
    And tx1 locks 10 metavcoin to key2
    And tx1 locks 90 metavcoin to key3

    When executing c3 on tx1 returning tx2
    And signing tx2 with genesisKey2
    And validating a block containing activationTx,tx2 extending tip
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 10
    Then c3 should be active for 1 block

    When validating an empty block mkMain1 extending tip
    Then c3 should not be active
    And state of c3 should be u32 of 10

    Given reactivationTx has the input activationTx index 2
    And reactivationTx activates c3 for 5 blocks
    And reactivationTx locks change metavcoin to activationTxChangeKey2
    And reactivationTx is signed with activationTxChangeKey

    And tx3 has the input tx2 index 1
    And tx3 locks 90 metavcoin to tx3_key1

    When executing c3 on tx3 returning tx4
    And signing tx4 with key3
    And validating a block containing reactivationTx,tx4 extending tip
    Then state of c3 should be u32 of 11
    Then c3 should be active for 4 block
